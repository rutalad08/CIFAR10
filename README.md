# Image Recognition using CIFAR-10 dataset                                                                                        

Fetched the CIFAR-10 dataset using keras package in python and launched tensor-board to plot the accuracies.
Implemented CNN model on the dataset to classify images in one of the 10 categories and evaluated the model on GPU by introducing Google Colab for faster execution. Modified the network architecture and hyper-parameters of the model. In addition, pioneered data augmentation and batch normalization techniques to improve the performance and accuracy.
Accomplished test accuracy of 84% on the CIFAR-10 dataset
